# Light Detection System – Arduino Project  

This repository contains the **Light Detection System** using **Arduino**, designed to measure ambient light levels and control an **LED** accordingly. It is ideal for **automatic lighting**, **smart home automation**, or learning about light-sensitive circuits.  

## Features  
- **Light Sensing:** Uses an LDR sensor to detect brightness levels.  
- **LED Control:** Automatically turns the LED on or off based on light intensity.  
- **Serial Monitoring:** Displays real-time sensor readings.  

## Wiring  

### LDR Sensor  
- `Signal` → Pin **A0**  
- `VCC` → **5V**  
- `GND` → **GND**  

### LED  
- `Signal` → Pin **3**  
- `VCC` → **5V**  
- `GND` → **GND**  

## Usage  
1. Connect the **LDR sensor** and **LED** as per the wiring guide.  
2. Upload the provided **Arduino code** to your board.  
3. Monitor light detection output via the **Serial Monitor**.  
4. The **LED** will turn on in dark conditions and turn off in bright conditions.
